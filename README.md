# Dream-Scan
 Active Reconaissance Made Simple!
Our team of four individuals from a full stack cybersecurity bootcamp collaborated on the Dream Scan project. 
We developed a Python script that combines commonly used active reconnaissance tools like Nmap, Searchsploit, and Metasploit. 
Our goal was to simplify and automate the process of active reconnaissance for beginner-level security analysts, making their tasks more efficient and effective. 
Our teamwork and compatibility allowed us to work seamlessly together and create a successful project.
